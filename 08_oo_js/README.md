# Object-Oriented Programming
- Objects
  - Keys and Values
    - Keys must be strings
    - Values can be any data type
  - Object Creation
    - Object literals
    - Object literals with Methods
    - Shared methods
    - Object Factories
    - Constructors
    - `Class` syntax
    - Private members with closures

- Constructor Functions
  - `function className(...) { ... }`
  - Parameters into the method can be assigned to our object
  - Creating new objects with `new`
  - Adding methods onto our objects
    - While we could apply them to the constructor, this will create a new method each time.
- Prototypes
  - Attaches methods for every instance
  - `className.prototype.func`
- ES6 `Class` Syntax
  - `constructor()` function
  - Instance methods
  - Class Methods and `static`
